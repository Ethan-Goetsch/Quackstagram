# New Functionality

The additional functionality we want to implement is a messaging systems between users. Users would be able to message each other through direct messages or in groups. This system would then provide notifications to users as well employ an admin system. Further functionality we wish to implement is an admin system where admin users have authority to remove posts and moderate users. Messaging groups would then have administrators that would moderate the group.

  

These new functionalities would have a significant impact on our application, as we would have similar functionality to our competitor's products, allowing us to compete with them. With the use of moderators and admins our app would become safer, which would give us an edge over our competitors as well as provide security to our users.
